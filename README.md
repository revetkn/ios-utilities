## What is this?

A collection of ARC-only iOS utility code built in my spare time over the years and now publicly released.

It's not namespaced, but if I ever package this properly as a library for general use I'll do so.

There is low-hanging cleanup fruit in some spots, and the style isn't always great - this code was mostly pre-ARC and the main work since then has been migrating it over.  But it should be functional.
